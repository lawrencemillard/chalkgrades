my lazy ass never finished this readme
actually i once did but i used to suck at version control and my lazy ass is NOT digging up the archive from my old pendrive
also please proceed with caution as all of this code is from last year and it sucks and im genuinely ashamed of it and don't expect to be forgiven for it, feel free to roast it as much as you want

okay that's it
